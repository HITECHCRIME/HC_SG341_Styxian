## Lyrics

```
Pain on some waiting for a kick
drill low rumble paying for the rich
ensemble, pacing like i'm sick
pitch black, is it bad for the pack now
fully stashed die hard tribe rolling on a route
our tracks out never really sure who's on our back aimed
back to the blunted dice of facts, what's the matter blood
paradise of that one promise never came about

there is some way to fork (work?)
and deal with you humble
make it for the reach but tumble
getting really sick bitch, back 
into stack, fallen fast - NOW, 
fully snatched, i otta try
bully on the roots, got tracks 
but never really show it what's in my mind 
inna back, really can i only place the traps
what all this about 
reedem blessing but make promise never keep a tab
ey


it that these racks

mad stats

now you freaked and going down

into cover

never too rushed to anyone's bidding
